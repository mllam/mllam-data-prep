class DimMapping:
    """
    Defines the process for mapping dimensions and variables from an input
    dataset to a single new dimension (as in dimension in the
    output dataset of the dataset generation).

    There are three methods implemented for mapping:
    - "rename":
        Renames a dimension in the dataset to a new name.

        E.g. adding a dim-mapping as `{"time": {"method": "rename", "dim": "analysis_time"}}`
        will rename the "analysis_time" dimension in the input dataset to "time" dimension in the output.

    - "stack_variables_by_var_name":
        Stacks all variables along a new dimension that is mapped to the output dimensions name given.

        E.g. adding a dim-mapping as
        `{"state_feature": {"method": "stack_variables_by_var_name", "name_format": "{var_name}{altitude}m", dims: [altitude]}}`
        will stack all variables in the input dataset along the "state_feature" dimension in the output
        and the coordinate values will be given as f"{var_name}{altitude}m" where `var_name` is the name
        of the variable and `altitude` is the value of the "altitude" coordinate.
        If any dimensions are specified in the `dims` attribute, then the these dimensions will
        also be stacked into this new dimension, and the `name_format` attribute can be used to
        use the coordinate values from the stacked dimensions in the new coordinate values.

    - "stack":
        Stacks the provided coordinates and maps the result to the output dimension.

        E.g. `{"grid_index": {"method": "stack", "dims": ["x", "y"]}}` will stack the "x" and "y"
        dimensions in the input dataset into a new "grid_index" dimension in the output.

    Attributes:
        method: The method used for mapping.
        dims: The dimensions to be mapped.
        name_format: The format for naming the mapped dimensions.

    Attributes
    ----------
    method: str

        (e.g. two datasets that coincide in space and time will only differ in the feature dimension,
