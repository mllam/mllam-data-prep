    Calculate statistics for a given DataArray by applying the operations
    specified in the Statistics object and reducing over the dimensions
    specified in the Statistics object.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ds : xr.Dataset
        Dataset to calculate statistics for
    statistics_config : Statistics
        Configuration object specifying the operations and dimensions to reduce over
    splitting_dim : str
        Dimension along which splits are made, this is used to calculate differences
        for operations prefixed with "diff_", for example "diff_mean" or "diff_std".
        Only the variables which actually span along the splitting_dim will be included
        in the output.

    Returns
    -------
    stats : Dict[str, xr.Dataset]
        Dictionary with the operation names as keys and the calculated statistics as values
